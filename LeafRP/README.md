    - Base chest form json ui, modified by Trashy

    - I stole a thousand icons from a few of their games :3

## Rules For Developers

- Keep the resource pack under 12MB
- If any new icons are over 128x128 they must be downscaled, just enough to decrease the file size a bit but still no noticable difference
- Only Trashy or people she manually approves can modify the json ui
- Any new changes must be logged in devlogs.md

## Update RP2

- Optimized the resource pack, went from ~30MB to ~7MB
